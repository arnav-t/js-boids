### 2D simulation of boids in JavaScript
![boids](https://i.imgur.com/RdPg4XM.png "Boids")        
Boids display chaotic behavior emerging from simple rooms. The movement of Boids can be characterized as either chaotic (splitting groups and wild behaviour) or orderly. Unexpected behaviours, such as splitting flocks and reuniting after avoiding obstacles, can be considered emergent.            
This demo is written in JavaScript.
